Pocket FM

A high-performance, full-stack application designed for PocketFM to scrape and extract structured data from Amazon Bestseller lists. It features deep-link detail extraction, high-concurrency tab orchestration, and professional Excel data formatting.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **High-Concurrency Scraping**: Orchestrates up to 15 concurrent tabs in a single browser instance to minimize extraction time.
- **Deep Extraction (Part 2)**: Automatically visits every individual product page to extract Descriptions, Publishers, and Publication Dates.
- **Professional Excel Export**: Generates auto-sized, text-wrapped Microsoft Excel (`.xlsx`) files using Pandas and OpenPyXL.
- **Data Cleaning Engine**: Standardizes ratings, review counts, and normalizes unicode text (NFKD) to remove zero-width characters and stray punctuation.
- **ChatGPT-Inspired UI**: A modern, glassmorphic React interface with real-time backend processing logs.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11, Flask, Playwright (Async), Pandas, OpenPyXL.
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Lucide React, Axios.
- **Orchestration**: `concurrently` (runs Flask and Vite with one command).
